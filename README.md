# cnn-mri
Convolutional neural networks for analysis of cortical anatomy; experiments with different network architectures and input formats + data augmentation

- Data augmentation:  
  - angle jitter  
-- TO DO: --  
  - label noise    
  - training via Contrastive Learning  
  - other curricula / scheduled learning  

- Architectures:  
  - transfer learning with ResNet  
  - self-attention layers in the style of SAGAN  
  - VAE-like image-reconstruction error  
-- TO DO: --  
  - GAN?  
  - Spline n.n. final layers?  
  - Geometric deep learning (e.g., ConvNet with discrete Riemannian metric)
